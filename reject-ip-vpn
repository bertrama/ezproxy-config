# It's come to my attention that a few mass downloaders will connect to a remote institution's VPN
# before connecting to our EZProxy server.  I believe that few of our legitimate users will be
# connecting from a vpn on some other institution's campus, so I propose we make a list of our VPN
# IP ranges here to create a communal RejectIP file.  Each institution should remove its own entry
# before using this file.
